![Front-end developer](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D5616AQGsXWm6Z4uM9A/profile-displaybackgroundimage-shrink_350_1400/0/1719819618930?e=1725494400&v=beta&t=vH3ZICSYHSqPJhGoJ1r2jsTwkES_hBIxtCAclt-vFds)

I am a front-end developer with a background in architecture, I merge creativity with technical precision. In architecture, I managed projects from concept to completion, including residential, office, and educational buildings.
Now focused on front-end development, I’m eager to apply my skills in JavaScript and React to create great user experiences. I’m actively looking or a full-time front-end role where I can work on innovative projects and grow in this dynamic field.

I see parallels between architecture and coding, both requiring spatial vision, graphic design skills, attention to detail, and problem-solving.

Skills: REACT / JS / HTML / CSS
