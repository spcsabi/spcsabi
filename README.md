# Csaba Spengler
## Front-end developer

I am a front-end developer with a background in architecture, I merge creativity with technical precision. In architecture, I managed projects from concept to completion, including residential, office, and educational buildings.
Now focused on front-end development, I‚Äôm eager to apply my skills in JavaScript and React to create great user experiences. I‚Äôm actively looking or a full-time front-end role where I can work on innovative projects and grow in this dynamic field.

I see parallels between architecture and coding, both requiring spatial vision, graphic design skills, attention to detail, and problem-solving.
